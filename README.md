# CSS Display Info

When I started my journey into CSS & SASS, I would always run into the problem of flexbox. Never remembering what properties I could use, I was stuck for sometimes hours trying to figure out why my nav bar wasn't aligning to the center.

So I decided to create CSS Display Info - a small CSS and HTML only site with a few animations and enough information to remind me of where to go.

I used Figma for the UI/UX design, and HTML and CSS for the code. I hope to create a similar version for display:grid one day.

In the meantime feel free to look at the website!
